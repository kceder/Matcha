## MATCHA ðŸ”¥
**Matcha is a fullstack dating website project.** Created with @amedeomajer, we used React for the front-end part and Node.js with Express for the back-end. We decided to use technologies we weren't familiar before so the challenge as real. In the end we managed to pass the project with full score and full bonuses, 125/100.

The two months we spent learning new technologies and building this project taught us a lot! We would definitely do some things differently if we would start again with the knowledge we now have. More reusable components, even more simple database structure and probably a different CSS framework to nema some. After feedback, I'd be ready move away from my simplistic color palette to more colourfull one too.ðŸŽ¨
These are all things that I am certainly going to be focusing on my next (and the last) project which is a streaming service.
